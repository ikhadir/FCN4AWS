    "1) Follow the README.md file in the github repository https://github.com/ikhadir/FCN4AWS. This will guide you through step by step instructions on how to launch an EC2 instance, install PyTorch and CUDA, setup an account to request climate data using CDS API, install the ECMWF ```ai-models``` plugin, and generate a 6-hourly 40 step forecast of 72 variables.\n",

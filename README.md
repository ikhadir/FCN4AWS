# San Diego State University Climate Informatics Lab (SCIL) - FCN4AWS
A user guide for generating AI weather forecasts using AWS

AI weather predictions have now become more popular as seen by a number of data driven weather forecasting models 
such as FourCastNet, GenCast, GraphCast, Auroroa, and Pangu-Weather. These models have greatly reduced the need for 
extemely large super computing resources and have provided researches the opportunity to make weather predictions 
with access to just one GPU. San Diego State University Climate Informatics Lab has already demonstrated the ability 
of a small research group, in collaboration with university IT department and NVIDIA scientists, to produce high 
quality AI weather predictions. A user's guide has been created on github to replicate our work.

SCIL provides this user guide which will be primarily useful to research groups and weather enthusiasts who would 
like produce high quality global weather forecasts and do not have access to a local or shared GPU cluster. Our 
approach is then to determine the computational resources required and services which can be provided by cloud 
computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services.
